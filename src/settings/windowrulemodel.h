/**
 * @brief A single flat list model over the unified WindowRule set.
 *
 * This is the *only* model behind the Window Rules page. There are no
 * per-section proxy models — `WindowRulesPage.qml` derives section buckets,
 * search filtering, and chip filtering in QML over this one model.
 *
 * The model is staging: it holds an in-memory `QList<WindowRule>` that the
 * `WindowRuleController` populates from the daemon's `org.plasmazones.WindowRules`
 * D-Bus surface, mutates locally as the user edits, and flushes back to the
 * daemon on commit. The model never talks to D-Bus itself.
 *
 * ## SectionRole — derived in C++
 *
 * Every rule is bucketed into exactly one section, computed from its match
 * expression + actions:
 *   - `monitor`     — context-only rule (ScreenId / VirtualDesktop / Activity)
 *                     whose actions are layout / engine / disable. The
 *                     "Monitor & Layout" group.
 *   - `application` — a window-property rule (AppId / WindowClass / …) whose
 *                     actions are float / exclude / opacity / engine.
 *   - `activity`    — reserved alias for context-only rules pinned to an
 *                     Activity only (still surfaces under `monitor` visually,
 *                     but the chip filter distinguishes them).
 *   - `animation`   — any rule carrying an OverrideAnimation* action.
 *   - `advanced`    — anything that "graduated": a composite match a
 *                     specialized section cannot represent, or a mixed action
 *                     set. The Advanced / Custom group.
 *
 * A rule "graduates" to `advanced` the moment its shape exceeds what a
 * specialized section can edit without data loss — the specialized views then
 * never see it, so they cannot corrupt it.
