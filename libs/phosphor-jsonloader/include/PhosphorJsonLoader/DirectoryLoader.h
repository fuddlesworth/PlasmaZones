/**
 * @brief Generic JSON-directory loader with debounced live reload.
 *
 * Handles the scaffolding every `LoadBag → register with a registry`
 * loader needs:
 *
 *   • Top-level `*.json` scan of every registered directory, in order
 *     (later directories override earlier — pass dirs in system-first,
 *     user-last for the standard user-wins layering).
 *   • `QFileSystemWatcher`-backed live reload with a 50 ms single-shot
 *     debounce, which coalesces the save-temp-rename dance most
 *     editors perform into a single rescan.
 *   • **Parent-directory watching** when the target doesn't exist yet.
 *     Fresh-install consumers that create the user-data dir on first
 *     write still get hot-reload — the loader notices when the target
 *     materialises and promotes to direct watch.
 *   • **Stale-entry purge** on rescan: deleted files' keys are
 *     reported to the sink as `removedKeys` so the sink can
 *     unregister them. The sink always gets the authoritative current
 *     set, not an append-only view.
 *
 * Schema-specific concerns live in the consumer-supplied
 * `IDirectoryLoaderSink`: parse one file, commit one batch.
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 *
 * GUI-thread only. The watcher and the debounce timer live on the
 * thread the loader was constructed on. Call `loadFromDirectory` and
 * `requestRescan` from the same thread.
