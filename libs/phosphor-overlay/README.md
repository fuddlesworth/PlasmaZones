> Per-screen layer-shell shell hosts, slot vocabulary, and animator-config
> wiring for multi-slot overlays.

## Responsibility

Helper layer on top of [`phosphor-layer`](../phosphor-layer/README.md),
[`phosphor-surfaces`](../phosphor-surfaces/README.md), and
[`phosphor-animation`](../phosphor-animation/README.md). Given a
consumer-provided surface factory, `ShellHost` owns the per-screen
layer-shell shell lifecycle (create / destroy / rekey), the slot map
keyed by consumer-chosen slot names, animator-driven slot hides, and
per-role animator-config registration. The library knows nothing about
zones, layouts, or specific content. Consumers wire their slot
vocabulary through callbacks.

## Key types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `PhosphorOverlay::ShellHost`             | Owns the per-screen `ShellState` map, lifecycle methods, animator wiring. |
| `PhosphorOverlay::ShellState`            | Per-screen mechanism state: layer-shell surface, QQuickWindow, physical screen, slot map. |
| `PhosphorOverlay::SlotEntry`             | One slot entry: `QPointer<QQuickItem> item` + `PhosphorLayer::Role role`. |
| `PhosphorOverlay::makePerInstanceRole()` | Build a per-instance Role by appending `-{screenId}-{generation}` to a base scope prefix. |

## Typical use

```cpp
using namespace PhosphorOverlay;

ShellHost host;
host.setSurfaceAnimator(&animator);                          // from phosphor-animation

host.setSurfaceFactory([&](const QString& sid, QScreen* s) {
    const auto role = makePerInstanceRole(MyShellBaseRole, sid, mgr.nextScopeGeneration());
    return mgr.createSurface(/* role, qml url, screen, ... */);
});

host.setPostCreateCallback([&](const QString& sid, ShellState& state) {
    // Look up content slot Items by their QML object names, wire QML
    // signals, prime the RHI pipeline. Insert one SlotEntry per slot:
    auto* item = qvariant_cast<QQuickItem*>(state.shellWindow()->property("osdSlotItem"));
    state.slots.insert(QStringLiteral("osd"), SlotEntry{item, MyOsdRole});
});

host.setPreDestroyCallback([&](const QString& sid) {
    // Drop any parallel consumer-side per-screen state so a stale signal
    // firing during teardown doesn't dereference a dangling pointer.
});

// Lifecycle:
host.registerConfigForRole(MyOsdRole, buildOsdConfig());
host.ensureShell(screenId, physScreen);
host.syncSurfaceState(screenId, /*anyVisible=*/true, /*anyInputGrabbing=*/false);
host.hideSlot(screenId, QStringLiteral("osd"), [&]{ /* on hide-leg settle */ });
host.destroyShell(screenId);
```

## Design notes

- **Stable pointers via raw owning pointers.** `ShellState` entries are
  heap-allocated, and the host stores `QHash<QString, ShellState*>`.
  Consumers cache the `ShellState*` returned by `ensureShell` /
  `stateFor` in parallel per-screen state and rely on the pointer
  staying valid across rehashes. `QHash<QString, std::unique_ptr<ShellState>>`
  would move the pointee but still rehash the bucket array, so
  consumer-cached references are stable only by the indirection.
  `std::shared_ptr` would add refcount overhead the lib does not need
  (there is one owner, the host, plus any number of borrowed observers).
  `ShellState` is non-copyable / non-movable to prevent accidental
  `auto copy = host.stateFor(id)` (note the missing `&`) from
  shallow-cloning the mechanism pointers and slot map.
- **Callback-driven content boundary.** Three function-object hooks
  (`SurfaceFactory`, `PostCreateCallback`, `PreDestroyCallback`) carry
  every consumer-specific decision: which role / qmlSource the surface
  uses, which slot QML object names to look up, which signal handlers
  to wire, which parallel content state to clear at teardown. The
  library owns surface lifecycle, and the consumer owns content.
- **Slot role pinned at wire time.** Each `SlotEntry` carries the
  `PhosphorLayer::Role` the slot animates as, so `hideSlot` can drive
  `SurfaceAnimator::beginHide` without the caller re-specifying the
  role at every dismiss / cancel call site.
- **`syncSurfaceState` is mechanism-only.** Consumers compute
  `anyVisible` and `anyInputGrabbing` from their content slot
  visibility (e.g. modal vs non-modal classification), and the library
  decides surface mapping + `Qt::WindowTransparentForInput` toggling.
- **Sticky per-screen creation failure.** When the surface factory
  returns nullptr for a screen, the host flags it. Subsequent
  `ensureShell` calls short-circuit until `clearFailure(screenId)` is
  called, typically on hot-plug. `failureScreenIds()` exposes the
  current set so consumers with their own id grammar (e.g. virtual-
  screen prefixes) can clear by prefix without the library learning
  the grammar.

## Dependencies

- `QtCore`, `QtQuick`
- [`phosphor-layer`](../phosphor-layer/README.md) — `Role`, `Surface`,
  wlr-layer-shell wire primitives.
- [`phosphor-shell-patterns`](../phosphor-shell-patterns/README.md) —
  UI-pattern recipes the consumer composes base roles from.
- [`phosphor-surfaces`](../phosphor-surfaces/README.md) — managed
  surface lifecycle + scope-generation counter.
- [`phosphor-animation`](../phosphor-animation/README.md) —
  `SurfaceAnimator` that drives every overlay show / hide leg.
- [`phosphor-screens`](../phosphor-screens/README.md) — screen
  topology + stable identifiers (consumer-facing dep, since the lib itself
  only forward-declares `QScreen`).
