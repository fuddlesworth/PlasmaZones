/**
 * @brief Shared base for the five per-T `PhosphorAnimated*` Q_OBJECTs.
 *
 * Phase 4 decision O refinement. Holds the cross-T plumbing —
 * `window` property (resolves clock through `QtQuickClockManager`),
 * `profile` property, lifecycle flags — so each typed subclass can
 * focus on its T-specific `from` / `to` / `value` surface and
 * `start` / `retarget` overloads. Not instantiable from QML
 * (registered `QML_UNCREATABLE`) — consumers pick
 * `PhosphorAnimatedReal` / `…Point` / `…Size` / `…Rect` / `…Color`.
 *
 * ## Auto-advance
 *
 * On `setWindow(window)`, the base connects to
 * `QQuickWindow::beforeSynchronizing` with `Qt::DirectConnection`.
 * That signal fires on the GUI thread (render thread blocked during
 * sync) once per frame — the natural tick granularity for an
 * animation. The connected slot calls the derived class's `onSync()`
 * which pumps `AnimatedValue<T>::advance` and emits whatever
 * property-change signals the tick produced.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT using `afterFrameEnd` / `frameSwapped` (render
 * thread) to avoid cross-thread signal dispatch into QML's property
 * binding evaluator (GUI-thread-only). `beforeSynchronizing` is
 * GUI-thread by Qt's contract.
 *
 * Tests can drive manually via `advance()` without a window bound —
 * the subclass pumps its `AnimatedValue<T>::advance()` directly, no
 * clock needed for the step (spec's `clock` must still be non-null
 * at `start()` time, so tests supply a TestClock via the public
 * `start()` overload's clock parameter — sub-commit-level test hook
 * covered in the subclass API).
