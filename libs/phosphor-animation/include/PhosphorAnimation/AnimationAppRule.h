/**
 * @brief One per-window animation override entry.
 *
 * Sits alongside the per-event `ShaderProfileTree` in the same
 * `org.plasmazones.settings` config namespace. Where the tree provides
 * a global default per event path (e.g. "every window-open uses
 * pop-in"), an `AnimationAppRule` overrides that default for a
 * specific window-class pattern (e.g. "firefox uses dissolve, but
 * everything else stays pop-in").
 *
 * ## Schema decisions (settled)
 *
 *   - Per-event scope: each rule names one `eventPath` only. To
 *     override the same pattern across multiple events, write a
 *     separate rule per event.
 *   - Single-axis: each rule carries EITHER a `Shader` override OR a
 *     `Timing` override, not both. Override both for the same
 *     (pattern, eventPath) by writing two rules.
 *   - Substring, case-insensitive matching (mirrors snap App Rules).
 *   - First-match per axis (the resolver walks the list and returns
 *     the first matching rule whose `kind` matches the requested
 *     axis).
 *   - Empty `effectId` in a `Shader` rule = engaged-blocking
 *     sentinel: "no animation for this app on this event," winning
 *     over the per-event default.
 *
 * ## Cascade
 *
 * Resolution at window-event time is:
 *
 *   1. `AnimationAppRuleList::resolve{Shader,Timing}(windowClass,
 *      eventPath)` — first matching rule of that axis. If hit, done.
 *   2. `Settings::shaderProfileTree.resolve(eventPath)` — the user's
 *      per-event override, if engaged.
 *   3. The library default (empty `ShaderProfile`).
 *
 * The rule layer wins over the per-event override. If a user has
 * configured both, they intended the per-app rule to take precedence
 * on matching windows.
