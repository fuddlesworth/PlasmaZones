 * @brief Captures snap-assist window thumbnails inside the KWin process.

 * Uses @c KWin::OffscreenQuickScene plus the @c WindowThumbnail QML element
 * from @c org.kde.kwin to render each candidate window through the live
 * compositor texture and grab the result as a QImage. No ScreenShot2 D-Bus
 * round-trip, no daemon-side @c X-KDE-DBUS-Restricted-Interfaces gate, no
 * second render of the window — KWin reuses the texture it already has.
 *
 * Captures run sequentially through one shared scene so at most one
 * QSGRenderContext + grab pass is in flight, mirroring the throttling the
 * daemon's previous ScreenShot2 path needed (concurrent CaptureWindow calls
 * could starve KWin's screenshot queue). Each completed image is posted
 * back to the daemon via @c org.plasmazones.Overlay.setSnapAssistThumbnail
 * as a base64 PNG data URL — the daemon decodes once into its bounded LRU
 * QImage cache and never carries the encoded form past that point.
