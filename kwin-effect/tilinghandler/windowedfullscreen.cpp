// imposed on a window (KWin maximize for monocle, KWin fullscreen plus a
// keep-flag demotion for windowed fullscreen), and in both cases the effect is

// only on an arm that actually restores, never merely because the window's
// situation changed. See unmaximizeMonocleWindow for why the fullscreen guard
// sits above the removal rather than below it.
